## Locked Clinical Design
- One compact CaseRecord for homoeopathic case-taking.
- Narrative sections remain free text.
- Quick-generals and modalities use compact structured data.
- Every modality supports Agg/Amel plus additional text.
- Diagnosis is separate from homoeopathic assessment.
- ICD-11 is optional and searched on demand through the HHMS backend.
- Follow-ups are longitudinal records and do not overwrite the original case.
- Optional/empty clinical sections must never prevent saving or retrieval.

## Last Updated
- 2026-08-12 - Hospital Statistics Engine batch prepared.
