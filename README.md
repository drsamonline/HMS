| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 💻 **Client** | Lightweight HTML/CSS/vanilla-JavaScript interface hosted in WebView2 |
| 🔌 **Transport** | HTTP/JSON over the hospital LAN with automatic server discovery |
| 🗄️ **Server** | The only component that touches the shared SQLite database — the client never opens it directly |

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. Use the latest verified repository ZIP as the source of truth.
2. Implement work in coherent batches (largest safe batch).
3. Verify each batch against the intended change set.
4. Stage exact files and commit/push only after the staged audit is green.
